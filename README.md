# RAIN-INN Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview

This project is part of the RAIN-INN community and focuses on building a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system. The goal is to analyze audio data to recognize emotions based on speech. The project involves several stages, including loading the dataset, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data augmentation. The Modeling and Deployment stages will be added soon.


## System Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib librosa
```

## Project Stages

### Data

- **Load Dataset**: Import and prepare the dataset(s) for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform detailed analysis and visualizations to understand data characteristics and structure.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and segment the audio data to prepare it for feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the audio data for model training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset by applying transformations and generating synthetic samples to improve model robustness.

### Modeling

- **Model Training**: Develop and train machine learning models using the processed data and extracted features.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics and validation techniques.

### Deployment

- **Model Deployment**: Integrate the trained model into a production environment for real-world use.


## Contributing
Each unit should fork the repository and submit pull requests. For any issues or feature requests, please open an issue.
One person should create a fork named: person1_person2 then both person1 and 2 should be collaborators in that fork.
